# Activify

## This app was created during The UCL Dementia Hack.

From the organizers:

> A Hackathon challenging attendees to create an app that can delay or prevent dementia through encouraging lifestyle change, leading to increased quality of life, and prolonged independent living.

Our app encourages a healthy lifestyle by making it easier to discover local activities and stay engaged.
